    <h1>Wrox Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
      <p> I adapted this recipe from a book called
        <cite cite=”http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-
        /0864119917/”> Sydney Food </cite> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting
        these eggs on my 1 <sup> st </sup> visit to Bill’s restaurant in Kings
        Cross, Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed
        it into what I really believe are the <em> best </em> scrambled eggs
        I have ever tasted.
      </p>
      <p> This recipe is what I call a <q> very special breakfast </q> ; just
        look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.
